10/30: Full Attendance
Everyone planned on spending some time getting comfortable with React and Javascript for the project. Also planned to install our backend: Node.js. Those assigned to backend are to figure out how to get PostgreSQL working nicely with the React App, and frontend was to work on getting an API implemented.

11/1: Full Attendance
Everyone acknowledged we were behind. We decided that we needed to quickly get some sort of cashier interface working by tonight. I (Willem) also agreed to focus fixing our deployment so that our SQL queries will start working when deployed as well as locally.

11/3: Absent: Jack Smith
Now that the SQL queries are functional, the cashier can continue to be fleshed out. William continued to work on that cashier and I (Willem) was to work on integrating current branches on Github into the new file structure created when I was refactoring our project to get the SQL queries to work. I also was to begin work on the Google Translate API.
